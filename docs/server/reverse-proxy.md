# Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is a server that sits between clients and the backend server(s) that theyâ€™re trying to access. It receives requests from clients and forwards them to the backend server(s). The response from the backend server(s) is then sent back to the client.

## Update your server

You should update your server to make sure you have the latest software. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

## Install Nginx

```bash
apt install nginx
```

## Configure Nginx

Add a configuration file for your site in the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` directory. You can name the file whatever you'd like, but it should end with `.conf`. Here is an example configuration file for a relay:

```nginx
# relayrunner.xyz
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name relayrunner.xyz;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/relayrunner;
        allow all;
    }

    location / {
        root /var/www/relayrunner.xyz;
        index index.html;
    }
}

# www.relayrunner.xyz
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name www.relayrunner.xyz;

    return 301 http://relayrunner.xyz$request_uri;
}

map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    '' close;
}

upstream websocket {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;
}

# relay.relayrunner.xyz
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name relay.relayrunner.xyz;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/relayrunner;
        allow all;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://websocket;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace `relayrunner.xyz` with your domain name.

Create the directory for your relay homepage:

```bash
mkdir /var/www/relayrunner.xyz
```

Create an `index.html` file in the directory and add whatever information you'd like to include about your relay, here is an example:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Relay Runner</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Relay Runner</h1>
    <p>This is a personal relay for my notes and other stuff.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

now test your config and restart Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
nginx -t # if this command fails, you have a syntax error in your config

systemctl restart nginx
```
