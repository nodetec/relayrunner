# Relay Runner

This site will help you setup a relay for personal or public use. Relays are servers that transmit notes and other stuff to clients on the [nostr](https://nostr.com/) network and may (or may not) store them as well.

## Why run a personal relay?

Running a personal relay is a great way to keep your notes and other data under your control. You can use it as an archive for all of your data or maybe as a dedicated relay for a personal website.

## Why run a public relay?

Running a public relay is a great way to decentralize and help the nostr network grow. You also have the option to monetize your relay by charging clients for access.
