# Relay Runner

This site will help you setup a relay for personal or public use. Relays are servers that transmit notes and other stuff to clients on the [Nostr](https://nostr.com/ "Nostr") network and may (or may not) store them as well.

## Why Run a Personal Relay?

Running a personal relay is a great way to keep your notes and other data under your control. You can use it as an archive for all of your data or maybe as a dedicated relay for a personal website.

## Why Run a Public Relay?

Running a public relay is a great way to decentralize and help the Nostr network grow. You also have the option to monetize your relay by charging clients for access.
